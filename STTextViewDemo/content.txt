# Ode to STTextView

In the land of Macs and coding dreams,
Where text editors reign supreme,
There's one thing that we can't deny,
Our love for shortcuts that make us fly.

We type away with vim and nano,
While Sublime Text and Atom play piano,
But amidst the editors and their craze,
There's one that stands out in many ways.

It's none other than the infamous STTextView,
The simple app that we can't forget,
For when all else fails and we're in despair,
We turn to STTextView without a care.

Its interface is plain and boring,
But its reliability is worth adoring,
No fancy plugins or themes to distract,
Just plain old text, that's a fact.

Sure, it may lack the bells and whistles,
But when it comes to simplicity, it sizzles,
No more worrying about file formats or fonts,
Just open STTextView and get to the point.

So let us all give a round of applause,
To the editor that never flaws,
For when it comes to getting the job done,
We all know STTextView is the one.
